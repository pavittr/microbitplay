Me playing with the microbit library


Sample app where I tried out the microbit MicroPython library (spoiler: micropython is pretty cool :) )

Code was written using the [microbit python website](http://python.microbit.org/v/1). Its a simple space invaders type game.

- `a` to go left
- `b` to go right
- `a` and `b` at the same time to shoot
